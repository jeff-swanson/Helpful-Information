      "[PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1  Right pelvic pain2  Right ovarian massPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES1  Right pelvic pain2  Right ovarian mass3  8 cm x 10 cm right ovarian cyst with ovarian torsionPROCEDURE PERFORMED  Laparoscopic right salpingooophorectomyANESTHESIA  General with endotracheal tubeCOMPLICATIONS  NoneESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  Less than 50 ccTUBES  NoneDRAINS  NonePATHOLOGY  The right tube and ovary sent to pathology for reviewFINDINGS  On exam under anesthesia a normalappearing vulva and vagina and normally palpated cervix a uterus that was normal size and a large right adnexal mass  Laparoscopic findings demonstrated a 8 cm x 10 cm smooth right ovarian cyst that was noted to be torsed twice  Otherwise the uterus left tube and ovary bowel liver margins appendix and gallbladder were noted all to be within normal limits  There was no noted blood in the pelvisINDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE  The patient is a 26yearold G1 P1 who presented to ABCD General Emergency Room with complaint of right lower quadrant pain since last night which has been increasing in intensity  The pain persisted despite multiple pain medications given in the Emergency Room  The patient reports positive nausea and vomiting  There was no vaginal bleeding or discharge  There was no fevers or chills  Her cultures done in the Emergency Room were pending  The patient did have an ultrasound that demonstrated an 8 cm right ovarian cyst questionable hemorrhagic  The uterus and left ovary were within normal limits  There was a positive flow noted to bilateral ovaries on ultrasound  Therefore it was felt appropriate to take the patient for a diagnostic laparoscopy with a possible oophorectomyPROCEDURE  After informed consent was obtained and all questions were answered to the patients satisfaction in laymans terms she was taken to the operating room where general anesthesia was obtained without any difficulty  She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position with the use of Allis strips and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  Her bladder was drained with a red Robinson catheter and she was examined under anesthesia and was noted to have the findings as above  She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion  A weighted speculum was placed in the patients vagina with excellent visualization of the cervix  The cervix was grasped at 12 oclock position with a singletoothed tenaculum and pulled into the operative field  The uterus was then sounded to approximately 35 inches and then a uterine elevator was placed  The vulsellum tenaculum was removed  The weighted speculum was removed  Attention was then turned to the abdomen where 1 cm infraumbilical incision was made in the infraumbilical fold  The Veress step needle was then placed into the abdomen while the abdomen was being tented up with towel clamp  The CO2 was then turned on with unoccluded flow and excellent pressures  This was continued till a normal symmetrical pneumoperitoneum was obtained  Then a 11 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed into the infraumbilical port without any difficulty and placement was confirmed by laparoscope  Laparoscopic findings are as noted above  A suprapubic incision was made with the knife and then a 12 mm step trocar and sleeve were placed in the suprapubic region under direct visualization  Then a grasper was used to untorse the ovary  Then a 12 mm port was placed in the right flank region under direct visualization using a LigaSure vessel sealing system  The right tube and ovary were amputated and noted to be hemostatic  The EndoCatch bag was then placed through the suprapubic port and the ovary was placed into the bag  The ovary was too large to fit completely into the bag  Therefore a laparoscopic needle with a 60 cc syringe was used to aspirate the contents of the ovary while it was still inside the bagThere was approximately 200 cc of fluid aspirated from the cyst  This was a clear yellow fluid  Then the bag was closed and the ovary was removed from the suprapubic port  The suprapubic port did have to be extended somewhat to allow for the removal of the ovary  The trocar and sleeve were then placed back into the port  The abdomen was copiously irrigated with warm normal saline using the NezhatDorsey suction irrigator and the incision site was noted to be hemostatic  The pelvis was clear and clean  Pictures were obtained  The suprapubic port was then removed under direct visualization and then using a 0vicyrl and UR6  Two figureofeight sutures were placed in the fascia of suprapubic port and fascia was closed and the pneumoperitoneum was maintained after the sutures were placed  Therefore the peritoneal surface was noted to be hemostatic  Therefore the camera was removed  All instruments were removed  The abdomen was allowed to completely deflate and then the trocars were placed back through the sleeves of the right flank 12 port and the infraumbilical port and these were removed  The infraumbilical port was examined and noted to have a small fascial defect which was repaired with 0Vicryl and UR6  The right flank area was palpated and there was no facial defect noted  The skin was then closed with 40 undyed Vicryl in subcuticular fashion  Dressings were changed  The weighted speculum was removed from the patients cervix  The cervix noted to be hemostatic  The patient tolerated the procedure well  Sponge lap and needle counts were correct x2 and the patient was taken to the Recovery in stable condition]\n"

    "- fill-mask: Masked Language Modeling is a fill-in-the-blank task, where a model uses the context words surrounding a mask token to try to predict what the masked word should be. For an input that contains one or more mask tokens, the model will generate the most likely substitution for each.\n",
    "    - Input: \"I have watched this [MASK] and it was awesome.\"\n",
    "    - Output: \"I have watched this movie and it was awesome.\"\n",
    "- question-answering: Question answering is a task in information retrieval and Natural Language Processing (NLP) that investigates software that can answer questions asked by humans in natural language. In Extractive Question Answering, a context is provided so that the model can refer to it and make predictions on where the answer lies within the passage.\n",
    "- sentiment-analysis seeks to identify the writer’s (or speaker’s) mood, opinion, or feelings towards the topic.\n",
    "- summarization: Text summarization is the practice of breaking down long publications into manageable paragraphs or sentences. The procedure extracts important information while also ensuring that the paragraph's sense is preserved. This shortens the time it takes to comprehend long materials like research articles while without omitting critical information.\n",
    "- text-generation :It leverages knowledge in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence to automatically generate natural language texts, which can satisfy certain communicative requirements.\n",
    "- translation: a procedure when a computer software translates text from one language to another without human contribution\n",
    "- zero-shot-classification: capable of describing what class an unlabeled sample belongs to when it does not fall into the category of any of the trained categories. i.e. Zero shots for the datapoint."
